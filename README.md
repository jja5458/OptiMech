# OptiMech
OptiMech aims to simulate and optimize mechanical systems in buildings, such as HVAC systems, to reduce energy consumption and operational costs. Using historical data and real-time inputs, the project will develop predictive models to suggest optimal configurations that minimize energy use while maintaining performance.
